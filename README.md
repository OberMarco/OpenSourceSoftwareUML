## Introduction
	
To implement structured programs it is necessary to design UML(Unified Modeling Language)-diagrams. 
This is especially important in a scientific context, because it enables the scientific teams to better combine and unify solution strategies.
In scientific projects, the project budget is usually small. For this reason, expensive software products such as [visual paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) are not needed to create the diagrams. Therefore, different open source products for the creation of UML diagrams will be investigated.
	
	
## Projectdescription
	
Based on the creation of 1-2 UML diagrams, differences, advantages and disadvantages of open source solutions for UML diagrams will be worked out.
The created UML diagram will continue to be used in the research work of the Masters of applied Research. 
The focus of the diagrams is on the abstract and clear representation of software and software designs. The diagrams are intended to be used in a scientific context for publications and collaboration. The use of the diagrams is to be distinguished from UML diagrams, which are a detailed view of the implementation of the software.
	
## Software products
	
In this project, the following open source software are investigated and compared:
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/de/)
- [Integrated Latex UML - TikZ-UML](https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/index.php)
- [Draw.io App - UML](https://drawio-app.com/uml-diagrams/)
	
	
## Investigation criteria

- Time required for creation
- Time required for modification
- General visual impression
- Platform independence
- Scalability in diagram size
